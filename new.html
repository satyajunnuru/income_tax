        <div id="part1">
            <p id="text1">
                A new tax regime was introduced in Budget 2020 wherein the tax slabs were altered, and taxpayers were offered concessional tax rates. However, those who opt for the new regime cannot claim several exemptions and deductions, such as HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D and more. Because of this, the new tax regime did not have many takers. The government in Budget 2023 introduced 5 key changes to encourage taxpayers to adopt the new regime.

                <div id="h11">Latest update: Budget 2023 changes under new tax regime</div>
                <li>New tax regime will be the default tax regime. However, taxpayers can opt for the old regime</li>
                <li>A tax rebate has been introduced under the new tax regime on income up to Rs.7 lakhs. Therefore, you do not have to pay tax if your taxable income is below Rs.7 lakhs under the new tax regime
                </li>
                <li>The tax exemption limit of Rs.2.5 lakh has increased to Rs.3 lakh under the new tax regime and tax slabs have been recalibrated under the new tax regime</li>
                <li>The standard deduction of Rs 50,000 has been extended to the new tax regime as well</li>
                <li>The highest surcharge rate of 37% has been reduced to 25% under the new tax regime. This move impacts taxpayers earning more than Rs 5 crore. As a result, their overall tax rate will decrease from 42.74% to 39%</li>
