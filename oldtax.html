            <p id="text1">The old regime is the tax system that prevailed before the introduction of the new regime. Under this regime, there are over 70 exemptions and deductions available, including HRA and LTA, that can reduce your taxable income and lower tax payments. The most popular and generous deduction is Section 80C, which allows for a reduction of taxable income up to Rs.1.5 lakh. The taxpayers are given a choice between the old and the new tax regime.</p>
