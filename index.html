                    A taxpayer may be an individual or business entity that is obligated to pay taxes to a federal, state, or local government. Taxes from both individuals and businesses are a primary source of revenue for governments. In the United States, individual taxpayers are usually required to file and pay both federal and state tax returns annually. Businesses must also file annual returns but usually plan for and pay regular estimated tax payments throughout the year.

                In India, the Income Tax applies to individuals based on a slab system, where different tax rates are assigned to different income ranges. This means that as a person's income increases, the tax rates also increase. This type of taxation allows for a fair and progressive tax system in the country. The income tax slabs are revised periodically, typically during each budget. These slab rates vary for different groups of taxpayers. Let us take a look at all the slab rates applicable for FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24) and FY 2023-24(AY 2024-25).
